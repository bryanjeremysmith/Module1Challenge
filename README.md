# Module 1 Challenge Webpage

## Description

This feature request challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.  To impress clients, we should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability.  Make sure that all links are functioning correctly, reword the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

The User Story:

AS A marketing ageny<br>
I WANT A codebase that follows accessibility standards<br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines<br>

The Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards<br>
WHEN I view the source code<br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br>
WHEN I view the image elements<br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br>
THEN they fall in sequential order<br>
WHEN I view the title element<br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br>
